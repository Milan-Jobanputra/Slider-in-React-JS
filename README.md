# Slider-in-React-JS

Here In React.js, a slider is often implemented using the <input> element with its type attribute set to "range". 
You can use state to manage the value of the slider and update it based on user interaction. 
Here's a simple example of how you can create a slider in a React component:

useState is used to create a state variable (sliderValue) and a function (setSliderValue) to update its value.
The handleSliderChange function is called whenever the slider value changes. It updates the state with the new value.
The <input> element is of type "range" and has attributes like min, max, value, and onChange to control the behavior of the slider.
The label displays the current value of the slider.
